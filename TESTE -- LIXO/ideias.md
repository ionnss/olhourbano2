- The report for public transportations has to receive a input that no other categories have, regarding the bus or bus stations informations (bus number, bus line, bus stop/station, metro card, metro stations, metro code metro wagon number etc), like bus code, line etc. Its has.
    - Maybe add a field on the table for these informations

- We have to accept videos for the reports as well. Is that currently possible? 

- We have to add a create a table for reports to receive comments and votes for comments. These comments will be stored in a report id (reference). Each comment can also receive a vote and a comment. 

- Each comment will have the date made in days and the user reduced hashed cpf, like: [Olho Urbanos Eye]"OlhoUrbano" + "126asda17udg8...(example)" and a tiny vote icon with its number of votes (minimalist). This format should also appear in every report on feed and etc. 

- Filters

    - The filter, when users acess feed page, should have the city selected wherer users are acessing from. But they can change the city when selecting the city filter. The cities in filter should have the cities that are are registered in database (an have a muted text informing that). 

    - The filters should include filter for categories, most voted, most recent, most commented and other filters I cant think of for now

    - The filter should be a icon filter that opens a modal/pop up for users to select fixed on top of the feed page. However, for map, it should be a floating icon with box shadow on top of the map and attached to back button to feed. 

- We must add a color to pinpoints for each category. Each category has a diferent pinpoint color. Would it be possible to add the emoji symbol for each category in the midle of the rounder point of the pointer of the map? 

- The feed should show a list of reports with pagination. Maximum 9 reports per page. 

- The feed should also show a map button 

- Each report on the feed of reports should have a share button to share the report as png to social medias, with a qr code directing to that report page (since each report will have a dedicated url to it with its comments and votes and the pin point of it in the map, like a dashboard for each report)

- The map page wont have anything but the map, with floating back and filter card and the olho urbano logo on a card as well (both with box shadow to give a suspended feeling.) Also, each displayed pin point of each report created should be clickeble and show the report with its main info and voting button. Clicking outside of the report modal of the map should close it, or clicking in other pin point should close the last opened (if opened) and show the current clicked one. 

- Add a send message to olho urbano box to send request and contact with olhourbano.contato@gmail.com

- Add a muted info on email of report info informing that users will not have their email showed and shared with anyone. Its only used to inform users if the port has been solved and or send confirmation of votes and reports etc...
